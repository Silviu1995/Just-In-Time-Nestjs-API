# Just-In-Time-Nestjs-API

- I created this restapi to serve my personal delivery application.
- I used Nodejs as backend technology, and the Nestjs development framework.
- I created various endpoints, connected to a PostgreSQL database, to manage the authentication process, security and data storage.

To use the project you can make a clone of the repository, then run the "npm install" command.

The server can run with the "nest start" or "npm start" command.
